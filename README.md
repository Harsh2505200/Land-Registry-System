# 🏠 Land Registry System  

## 📌 Overview  
The **Land Registry System** is a **blockchain-based smart contract** designed to **securely register, verify, and transfer land ownership**. Built using **Solidity** and deployed on **Ethereum**, this system ensures **transparency, immutability, and fraud prevention** in land transactions.  

## ✨ Features  
✅ **Register Land Parcels** – Users can securely register land with a unique ID, location, and area.  
✅ **Ownership Transfer** – Only the current owner can transfer land ownership to another user.  
✅ **Instant Verification** – Anyone can verify land details directly on the blockchain.  
✅ **Fraud Prevention** – Ensures that only unregistered land can be added.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
🔷 **Blockchain Platform:** Ethereum  
📝 **Smart Contract Language:** Solidity (`^0.8.0`)  
🛠️ **Development & Testing:** Remix IDE  

🚀 Getting Started
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/land-registry-system.git
cd land-registry-system

2️⃣ Deploy Using Remix IDE
Open Remix IDE 🌐
Create a new Solidity file (LandRegistry.sol) and paste the contract code.
Compile the contract using Solidity Compiler (0.8.0 or later).
Deploy the contract using Injected Web3 (MetaMask) or a local Ethereum testnet.
