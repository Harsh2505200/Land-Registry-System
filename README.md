# 🏠 Land Registry System  

## 📌 Overview  
The **Land Registry System** is a **blockchain-based smart contract** designed to **securely register, verify, and transfer land ownership**. Built using **Solidity** and deployed on **Ethereum**, this system ensures **transparency, immutability, and fraud prevention** in land transactions.  

## ✨ Features  
✅ **Register Land Parcels** – Users can securely register land with a unique ID, location, and area.  
✅ **Ownership Transfer** – Only the current owner can transfer land ownership to another user.  
✅ **Instant Verification** – Anyone can verify land details directly on the blockchain.  
✅ **Fraud Prevention** – Ensures that only unregistered land can be added.  

## ⚡ Smart Contract Functions  

### 1️⃣ Register Land  
```solidity
function registerLand(uint256 _id, string memory _location, uint256 _area) public

📌 Registers a new land parcel with a unique ID, location, and area. The sender becomes the owner.
2️⃣ Transfer Ownership
```solidity
function transferOwnership(uint256 _id, address _newOwner) public
🔄 Allows the current owner to transfer land ownership to a new owner.

3️⃣ Get Land Details
```solidity
function getLand(uint256 _id) public view returns (uint256, string memory, uint256, address, bool)
🔍 Fetches details of a registered land parcel.

4️⃣ Check Registration Status
```solidity
function isLandRegistered(uint256 _id) public view returns (bool)
✅ Checks if a land parcel is registered on the blockchain.
